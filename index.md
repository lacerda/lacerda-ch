Hi! I'm Rafael. I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer focused on Natural Language Processing. I graduated from the University of Toronto with a MSc in Applied Computing in 2017.
I have carried out research, development and deployment of ML models and NLP, as well as general devops required to run a fast, secure and reliable platform.

Broad research areas I'm interested in and have experience are Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.

In another life I was an economist involved in finance, real estate and productivity management. I think both CS and Economics have a lot to benefit from each other and I'm always happy to talk about this.
