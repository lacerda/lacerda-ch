Hi! I'm Rafael. I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer focused on Natural Language Processing, Search and Recommendations.

I plan, lead and execute on research, development and deployment of ML and NLP systems, as well as general devops required to run fast, secure and reliable platforms.

Since 2019 I have been at [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/) as an Applied Research Data Scientist focused on Content Modeling.

Between 2017 and early 2019 I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Ross Intelligence](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/ai-success-story-u-t-s-ross-intelligence-returns-toronto-open-new-research-headquarters) where I developed a Natural Language search engine for the legal domain.

My key contributions in industry are in the following domains:

- Question Answering
- Learning-to-Rank
- Information Retrieval
- Item and User Embeddings
- Recommendation Systems
- Entity Extraction and Linking

In 2017 I graduated from the University of Toronto with a [MSc in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/). My focus was the application of Deep Learning methods for Question Answering in the legal domain.
