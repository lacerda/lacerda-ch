Hi! I'm Rafael. I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer focused on Natural Language Processing.

Since 2019 I have been at [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/) as an Applied Research Data Scientist focused on Natural Language Processing.

Between 2017 and early 2019 I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Ross Intelligence](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/ai-success-story-u-t-s-ross-intelligence-returns-toronto-open-new-research-headquarters) where I developed a Natural Language search engine for the legal domain. Key NLP highlights are Question Answering, Learning-to-Rank, Information Retrieval and Text Representation in dense vector space.

In 2017 I graduated from the University of Toronto with a [MSc in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/). My focus was the application of Deep Learning methods for Question Answering in the legal domain.

I have carried out research, development and deployment of ML models and NLP, as well as general devops required to run fast, secure and reliable platforms.

Broad research areas I'm interested in and have experience are Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation.
